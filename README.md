##### The goal of this project is to code a library that contain a simplified version of printf.
##### I used a linked list to store data, I realized that it wasn't the most efficient way but I wanted to practice with it
##### I also learned how to use the va_list
##### For this projetc I  write and use a bash script to test my ft_printf

##### The goal of this project is to sort a list of number with differents instructions
##### I discover the notion of complexity because I have to sort the list in a limited numbers of moves
##### I used a **Quicksort** algorithm, but I modified it to better fit the different instructions and the subject.
