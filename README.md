# About me
Hi, I'm Loic a French developer, I like to learn new stuff. I'm looking for opportunities that will enable me to develop my programming skills.

## My projects:

### All the projects include a Makefile and are free of memory leaks and all file descriptors used are closed.

---

### ft_printf

The goal of this project is to code a library that contain a simplified version of printf.

I used a **linked list** to store data, I realized that it wasn't the most efficient way but I wanted to practice with it.

I also learned how to use the **va_list**.

In this project I write and use a **bash script** to test my ft_printf.

### push_swap

The goal of this project is to sort a list of number with differents instructions.

I discovered the concept of complexity because I have to sort the list in a limited number of moves.

I used a **Quicksort** algorithm, but I modified it to better fit the different instructions and the subject.

### pipex

The goal of this project is to code a program that mimics the functionnement of **|**, **>** and **<** in bash.

I learned how to retrieve environment variables, use the C command **execve**, and utilize **fork** and **pipe** to transfer data between different processes.

### so_long

The goal of this project is to create a simple puzzle game using 42's graphic library.

### Philosophers

The goal of this project is to solve the the good old one problem of the philosophers, where *n* philosophers are seated around a table with a large bowl of spaghetti in the middle. There is a fork between each pair of philosophers. For example, if there is 1 philosopher, 1 fork is present, and for 3 philosophers, there are 3 forks. Each has a time to eat, to sleep and must eat before starving.

I learned how to use **threads** and **mutexes**.

### minishell

The goal of this project is to code a simplified version of a shell.

It was my first project with another student. I learned a lot about C through our exchanges and about collaborating using **Git**. I also deepened my knowledge of shell commands such as redirections (**>**, **>>**, **<**), heredoc (**<<**), and pipes (**|**). Additionally, I gained a better understanding of how a shell truly works.

### cub3D

The goal of this project is to create a 3D environment using the same 42 library as *so_long* and **raycasting** like the first FPS (doom for example).

---

### CPP

![ISO_C++_Logo svg(1)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/50e5a568-b6bc-4587-ba93-e46bca559dac)

The goal of these projects is to learn the basics of C++, like:

-  Orthodox canonical classes and Inheritance
-  Subtype polymorphism, abstract classes and interfaces
-  Try/Catch and Exceptions
-  Templates
-  Containers, iterators and algorithms

I also learned how to use dependencies in my makefile for the headers

### computorv1

![ISO_C++_Logo svg(1)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/50e5a568-b6bc-4587-ba93-e46bca559dac)

The goal of this project is to write a program that solves a **polynomial second or lower degree equation**.

---

### Inception

![docker-logo-png-transparent(2)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aaa252b5-af34-4f2e-9032-c8e83f6b0626)

The goal of this project is to create multiple **Docker images** from scratch and link them to build a fully functional WordPress website.

I learned about 
  - docker-compose
  - docker-network
  - docker's volume
  - nginx
  - MariaDB
  - php-fpm
